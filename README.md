# SURFS_UP WRITTEN ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this analysis is to help W.Avy determine the feasibility and profitability of opening a surf shop in Oahu. To do this, analysis containing rainfall and temperature data was analysed to determine weather conditions in Oahu, and interpret the results to determine the possibility of opening a surf shop in Oahu.

## RESULTS
### DIFFERENCES IN JUNE & DECEMBER WEATHER
â€¢	June has an average (mean) temperature of 75 degrees, while December has an average (mean) temperature of 71 degrees. June is deep in the summer, while December is winter (in many states). An average of 71 degrees in December for Oahu means that both summer and winter months are warm, and the likelihood for the surf/ice-cream shop to thrive year round is very high.
