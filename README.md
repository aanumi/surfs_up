# SURFS_UP WRITTEN ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this analysis is to help W.Avy determine the feasibility and profitability of opening a surf shop in Oahu. To do this, analysis containing rainfall and temperature data was analysed to determine weather conditions in Oahu, and interpret the results to determine the possibility of opening a surf shop in Oahu.

## RESULTS
### DIFFERENCES IN JUNE & DECEMBER WEATHER
•	June has an average (mean) temperature of 75 degrees, while December has an average (mean) temperature of 71 degrees. June is deep in the summer, while December is winter (in many states). An average of 71 degrees in December for Oahu means that both summer and winter months are warm, and the likelihood for the surf/ice-cream shop to thrive year round is very high.

•	The June max temp is 85 degrees, while the December max temp is 83 degrees. This shows that there will likely be a high demand for surf board items along with ice-cream, as people will look to cool in the water (by surfing), while others will want to ingest cold drinks to balance the high temperatures. These stats though different, both point to a high profitability index for the potential surf shop.

•	The minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees. While this is a little low from the minimum of June at 64 degrees, the standard deviation of 3.745 means that number could fluctuate upwards a little. The minimum temperature of 56 degrees for December may slightly affect demand of items like ice-cream at the surf shop.


## SUMMARY
Overall, both June and December statistics both indicate high chances of success of the new surf shop in Oahu. Oahu will make a great location for a new surf shop. While December min temperatures drop to about 56 degrees,  it is slightly significant, but not significant enough to impair sustainability or profitability. 

### TWO ADDITIONAL QUERIES
•	A query that returns information on precipitation along with temperatures to determine impending rainfall, and how those results affect the demand for the surf shop items like surf boards and ice-cream.
•	A query that returns the temperature data for all months, that can be analysed in order for the team to really forecast temperature, precipitation, and their impacts on demand as well as profitability. This will really help solidify the proposition of opening the surf shop and being open year-round.
